# Noir Playground

**Noir Playground** is a browser-based platform to write, compile, and generate ZK proofs from Noir code. Supports both manual editor input and `.nr` file uploads. It uses `nargo` and `barretenberg` under the hood for compilation and proving.

Next Plan – Roadmap for Noir Playground

[ ] Aztec Devnet Integration
Allow users to compile and deploy Noir contracts directly to the Aztec Devnet once access is granted.

[ ] Wallet SDK Integration
Enable wallet connection using @aztec/accounts or shield-labs/wallet-sdk to interact with private L2 accounts.

[ ] ACIR & Proof Explorer
Visualize ACIR bytecode, ABI, and proof output in a structured & user-friendly viewer.

[ ] Live Verification via Barretenberg
Add a UI tab to verify generated proofs using the verifier directly from the frontend/backend.

[ ] Smart Templates
Add ready-to-use Noir templates (e.g. ZK Token, Voting, Access Control) with explanations.

[ ] Shareable Links & Embed Mode
Generate unique links to share code snippets or embed the Playground in other docs/dapps.

[ ] Error Highlighting & Fix Suggestions
Add smart error detection to provide inline feedback and fixes when compilation fails.

[ ] Aztec Sandbox Upload Support
Optionally drag & drop artifacts to Aztec’s official playground or Remix plugin.
